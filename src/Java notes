Class variable
A class variable is a variable that any method in a class can access, including static 
methods such as main.When declaring a class variable, you have to two basic rules to follow:
>> You must place the declaration within the body of the class but not within any of the
	class methods.
>> You must include the word "static" in the declaration. The word static comes before
	the variable type.


Declaring and creating a Scanner object
	static Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in)
	
	To read an input value from the user, you can use one of these methods:
		sc.nextIn()
		sc.nextBoolean()
		sc.nextByte()
		sc.nextFloat()
		sc.nextDouble()
		sc.nextLine() >> read a String value from the user
		sc.nextLong() >> read a long value from the user
		sc.nextShort()
		
		But if read from a string, such as from a dialog box
		you need to parse the string to the data type you are going to use
			int x = Integer.parseIn("100")
			short x = Short.parseShort("100")
			long x = Long.parseLong("100")
			byte x = Byte.parseByte("100")
			float x = Float.parseFloat("19.95")
	
	To prevent the nextInt and similar methods from crashing with incorrect input data by 
	first using one the methods to test the next input to make sure it's valid.
		boolean hasNextBoolean() >> Returns true if the next value entered by user is a valid boolean value
		boolean hasNextByte()
		boolean hasNextDouble()
		boolean hasNextFloat()
		boolean hasNextInt()
		boolean hasNextLong()
		boolean hasNextShort()

JFrame.Pack()
Calling pack() sets the window's size as small as possible while 
granting all its components their preferred sizes.
